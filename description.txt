Railguns exclusively use their own ammo, known as Energy Shells. Energy shells are one-time use batteries make the railgun shoot a laser.
You can find the crafting recipes via recipe browser, or by talking to the guide with wire.
Not compatible with WeaponOut (causes some weird animations with the railguns) Sorry! Will fix soon

Patch notes for 3.0.0:
We finally have a mod logo! Is due to change eventually but hope it's fine for now!
We also have a new discord server! (see invite at top)
I've buffed all of the railguns (except default one) so that they are more useful against Hardmode enemies and bosses.

And to the rest of the TML discord server for providing feedback on sprites & helping out in general! You guys are awesome!
