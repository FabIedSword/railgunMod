Railgun mod adds railguns. (Who could have guessed?)

Railguns exclusively use their own ammo, known as Energy Shells. Energy shells are one-time use batteries make the railgun shoot a laser.
You can find the crafting recipes via recipe browser, or by talking to the guide with wire.
Not compatible with WeaponOut (causes some weird animations with the railguns) Sorry! Will fix soon

Patch notes for 5.0.0.

Hey everybody!

Sorry for waiting uh, two months.
We've got a rather small update, but I'm going to start trying to work on this mod more.

I added 'The Terrarail', a very powerful railgun able to toggle between full-auto and burst-fire.
Expect a bigger update within the coming weeks! :)
